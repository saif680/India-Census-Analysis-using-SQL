1]  Average Growth of States and Union Territories: After analyzing the growth rates of various states and union territories, it was observed that the average growth
varied across different regions. Some states exhibited high growth rates, while others experienced relatively slower growth.

2] Average Growth of India: The average growth rate of India, considering all states and union territories, was calculated. This provides an overall understanding of 
the country's population growth and helps in assessing the demographic trends at a national level.

3] Top 5 States Showing Highest Sex Ratio: By examining the sex ratios of different states, it was identified that certain states exhibited higher sex ratios compared 
to others. The top 5 states with the highest sex ratios were determined, indicating a relatively higher proportion of females in these regions.

4] Top 2 Districts in Each State Showing Highest Sex Ratio: Within each state, the analysis identified the two districts with the highest sex ratios. This information 
helps in understanding the variations in sex ratios at a more localized level and provides insights into the gender demographics within specific districts.

5] Average Literacy of Top 3 States: The average literacy rates of the top 3 states were calculated to assess the educational attainment in those regions.
Higher literacy rates indicate a higher proportion of the population with basic reading and writing skills, which is essential for socio-economic development.

6] Average Literacy Rate of Bottom 3 States: Similarly, the average literacy rates of the bottom 3 states were determined. This sheds light on the regions with 
lower literacy rates, highlighting areas that may require focused efforts and interventions to improve educational opportunities.

7] These findings contribute to a better understanding of population dynamics, gender demographics, and educational indicators across states and union territories 
in India. They provide valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders to make informed decisions and develop targeted interventions to address 
specific challenges and promote inclusive development.
